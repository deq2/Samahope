This is our simple 1st-version demo, which sets up a Twilio application using a local server, then using ngrok to upload the application to the cloud.

samahope-15

This is the main demo. The source code provided implements this application in Python. It uses the Twilio library to reserve a phone number that you text to use this application. We use Google app engine to upload the application itself to the cloud.

This demos an application for entering data into a form using SMS messaging. You use the application in the following way:
Text the number you acquired on your Twilio account "start".
The app should respond: "1. Date of Registration".
Continue entering information. If you make a mistake, type in "reset", and the app will start the entry from the beginning.
When you are finished entering data, the app will repeat back the info you have entered.

For instructions to run the demo, see the README in samahope-15.
